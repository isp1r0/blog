    <section class="post-content">
      <p>A response to <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/article/3050934/macs/on-its-40th-anniversary-40-things-we-love-about-apple.html">this
absurdity</a>.</p>
<p>These are literally just a summary of each of those slides.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple has a marketing team</li>
<li>their users are obsessed</li>
<li>they make decent clones of other products years after those products are the norm</li>
<li>they don&#39;t know their own target demographic</li>
<li>they make products</li>
<li>they make the same products year after year and announce them as if they&#39;re new</li>
<li>they make inferior products and market them as if they&#39;re worth buying</li>
<li>they still don&#39;t know their own users</li>
<li>their users are still obsessed</li>
<li>they have stores that sell their products</li>
<li>they put their products in boxes</li>
<li>they offer short-term care for their products after you buy them</li>
<li>they have stores that you have to wait to get into</li>
<li>they make products</li>
<li>they made products years ago, too</li>
<li>their products were not the exact same products as other products, years ago</li>
<li>one of the products they used to make was a printer</li>
<li>they also used to make... products</li>
<li>like an idiot, i don&#39;t back up my data. and when a hard drive fails, i prefer to buy a new computer of a different
brand and then blame an entire major segment of consumer electronics for my own stupidity.</li>
<li>i noce bought one of their products</li>
<li>they make overpriced things that don&#39;t offer anything that any other platform doesn&#39;t have, but i by their crap anyway</li>
<li>their smartphones offer all the same functionality that flip phones have</li>
<li>they make apps</li>
<li>at one point the company almost totally failed, but then didn&#39;t</li>
<li>some people who work at Apple aren&#39;t native English speakers</li>
<li>i buy their products both for myself and for my kids sometimes</li>
<li>they made another &#39;new&#39; product that had already been on the market for years</li>
<li>they even had a marketing team back when CDs were still a thing</li>
<li>they made a really shitty mouse that everyone hated, aww, look at them trying, so cute</li>
<li>applescript is such a joke that it wasn&#39;t going to be included in OS X until, whoops, someone put them on the spot
about it</li>
<li>there is a voice assistant</li>
<li>Apple had a version of BASIC which was almost the same but not <em>exactly</em> the same as any of the other BASICs on the
market at the time</li>
<li>they had PR person that nobody liked</li>
<li>their computers can run software, including some games</li>
<li>they have stores not just where you are but in other places also</li>
<li>they have both marketing and PR people</li>
<li>they sometimes sponsor events, in the same way that most large companies sometimes sponsor events</li>
<li>they sometimes have TV commercials</li>
<li>there are people who like their products enough to sometimes write about them</li>
</ul>
<p>... are you fucking kidding me?</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a couple of things to like about Macs/Apple. Keep in mind that I don&#39;t own their products, and never plan to.</p>
<ul>
<li>Their hardware doesn&#39;t suck. It&#39;s not great, performance-wise, especially given the cost, but it is nice to look at.</li>
<li>Under the hood, Mac OS X is a BSD. It&#39;s a PITA sometimes to actually get to the good parts, and it&#39;s a lot easier to
just have a computer running the OS you really want, but it can be made to act like a great OS.</li>
<li>Their stuff is trendy. All sorts of people who really really really believe in everything TV ads tell them will think
you&#39;re a slightly cooler person for having one.</li>
<li>...I got nothin&#39;. That&#39;s it.</li>
</ul>
