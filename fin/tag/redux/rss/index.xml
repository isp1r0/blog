it&#39;s not, and because those docs themselves are pretty overwhelming when
you&#39;re first trying out Redux, I&#39;m going to attempt to distill the docs and
bits of my own (admittedly limited) personal experience with Redux into a
couple of blog posts.</p>
<hr>
<p>The store is an object that holds state. There&#39;s only ever one store in Redux,
with many reducers that act on it.</p>
<p><code>getState()</code> returns the state from the store.</p>
<p><code>subscribe(listener)</code> says &quot;Hey, call <code>listener</code> when the state changes.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a <code>replaceReducer</code> but unless you&#39;re writing hot middlware or
something you probably won&#39;t touch this one.</p>
<p>State can by any type, though obviously it&#39;s probably best to just use an
object here.</p>
<p>Actions are always objects, and they always have a <code>type</code>.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code>store.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">dispatch</span><span class="hljs-params">({type: <span class="hljs-string">&#39;do-stuff&#39;</span>})</span></span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// it&#39;s conventional to use all uppercase, but it&#39;s also hideous. so.</span>
store.<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">dispatch</span><span class="hljs-params">({type: <span class="hljs-string">&#39;DO_OTHER_STUFF&#39;</span>, stuff: <span class="hljs-string">&#39;[things to do here, maybe]&#39;</span>})</span></span></code></pre><p>Action creators are functions that create actions based on any sorts of
arguments.</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-title">const</span> sendSomeData = &#39;send-some-<span class="hljs-typedef"><span class="hljs-keyword">data</span>&#39;</span>
<span class="hljs-title">const</span> sendSomeDataActionCreator = <span class="hljs-typedef"><span class="hljs-keyword">data</span> =&gt; <span class="hljs-container">({
  <span class="hljs-title">type</span> : <span class="hljs-title">sendSomeData</span>
, <span class="hljs-title">data</span>
})</span></span></code></pre><p>A &#39;bound&#39; action creator would be one that creates the action and immediately
dispatches it. This might be familiar to folks who&#39;ve worked with Flux before.</p>
<p>This is how you might have something like this in Flux:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> sendMoreData = data =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> doIt = {
    type : sendMoreData,
    data
  }
  dispatch(doIt)
}</code></pre><p>And this is how it&#39;d work in Redux:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><code><span class="hljs-comment">// assuming you already have the dispatch and action creator, you&#39;d just</span>
const boundSendMoreData = data =&gt;
  <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-title">dispatch</span><span class="hljs-params">(sendMoreData(data)</span></span>)</code></pre><p>There&#39;s also a <code>bindActionCreators()</code> to just do this for you, and React-Redux
has <code>connect()</code>.</p>
<p>Async actions should go through middleware to be turned into regular actions
before being dispatched.</p>
<p>Reducers always take state and an action and return state.
<code>reducer (state, action) =&gt; state</code>
These are what they sound like&mdash;reducing functions.
The state a reducer takes is your existing (or previous, I guess) state.
Reducers are pure functions.</p>
<p>A dispatch is a function that takes an action (or an async action). It may then
dispatch an action (or actions) which will affect the store.
There&#39;s a base <code>dispatch</code> that always sends an action to the reducer.</p>
<p>Middleware are about what you&#39;d expect&mdash;functions (HOF) that take a
dispatch function and return a dispatch function.</p>
<p>There are &#39;store enhancers&#39; that are higher-order functions that take a store
creator and return a different store creator. They&#39;re basically kind of a
middleware for the store creator. You probably won&#39;t directly use one, ever.
Instead you&#39;ll just use the regular store creator (<code>createStore</code>).</p>
