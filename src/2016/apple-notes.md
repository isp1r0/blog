A response to [this
absurdity](http://www.networkworld.com/article/3050934/macs/on-its-40th-anniversary-40-things-we-love-about-apple.html).

These are literally just a summary of each of those slides.

* Apple has a marketing team
* their users are obsessed
* they make decent clones of other products years after those products are the norm
* they don't know their own target demographic
* they make products
* they make the same products year after year and announce them as if they're new
* they make inferior products and market them as if they're worth buying
* they still don't know their own users
* their users are still obsessed
* they have stores that sell their products
* they put their products in boxes
* they offer short-term care for their products after you buy them
* they have stores that you have to wait to get into
* they make products
* they made products years ago, too
* their products were not the exact same products as other products, years ago
* one of the products they used to make was a printer
* they also used to make... products
* like an idiot, i don't back up my data. and when a hard drive fails, i prefer to buy a new computer of a different
  brand and then blame an entire major segment of consumer electronics for my own stupidity.
* i noce bought one of their products
* they make overpriced things that don't offer anything that any other platform doesn't have, but i by their crap anyway
* their smartphones offer all the same functionality that flip phones have
* they make apps
* at one point the company almost totally failed, but then didn't
* some people who work at Apple aren't native English speakers
* i buy their products both for myself and for my kids sometimes
* they made another 'new' product that had already been on the market for years
* they even had a marketing team back when CDs were still a thing
* they made a really shitty mouse that everyone hated, aww, look at them trying, so cute
* applescript is such a joke that it wasn't going to be included in OS X until, whoops, someone put them on the spot
  about it
* there is a voice assistant
* Apple had a version of BASIC which was almost the same but not _exactly_ the same as any of the other BASICs on the
  market at the time
* they had PR person that nobody liked
* their computers can run software, including some games
* they have stores not just where you are but in other places also
* they have both marketing and PR people
* they sometimes sponsor events, in the same way that most large companies sometimes sponsor events
* they sometimes have TV commercials
* there are people who like their products enough to sometimes write about them

... are you fucking kidding me?

Here's a couple of things to like about Macs/Apple. Keep in mind that I don't own their products, and never plan to.

* Their hardware doesn't suck. It's not great, performance-wise, especially given the cost, but it is nice to look at.
* Under the hood, Mac OS X is a BSD. It's a PITA sometimes to actually get to the good parts, and it's a lot easier to
  just have a computer running the OS you really want, but it can be made to act like a great OS.
* Their stuff is trendy. All sorts of people who really really really believe in everything TV ads tell them will think
  you're a slightly cooler person for having one.
* ...I got nothin'. That's it.
